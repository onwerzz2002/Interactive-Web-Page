into hexadecimal number and use that number

to change the background color of the page.

 

2.  two drop down list to select number of rows and columns

after clicking create button, a input fields with number of rows and columns will be created

a "Create Table" will also be created.


after you fill up the input fields and click "Create Table" button,

a table (with color boundary) will be created



other requirement:

   for example, if you refill the input fields and click create table button again,
   the previous table will be replaced by new table instead of appending a new one at the end.
